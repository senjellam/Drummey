# Drummey

## About
A simple drum simulator called Drummey. Inside the program the user can choose between 3 different
drum layouts. To play just press the displayed key on the keyboard.

## Software
To start Drummey you need Processing Version 3.5.4 and Sonic Pi Version 3.3.1. 
First of all open Drummey.rb with Sonic Pi and run the code inside. Then open Drummey.pde 
and start the sketch. It's necessary that the Sonic Pi code is already running before starting the 
sketch in Processing. Otherwise the program will not work.
